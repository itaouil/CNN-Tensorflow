# CNN-Tensorflow

A simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) developed following the Tensorflow tutorials using the APIs available.

The network has just two stages of convolutions and pooling, plus a dense layer (fully connected layer for the classification part). Cross-entropy and softmax are used.
